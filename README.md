The Prescriptions Platform is a web application designed to streamline the prescription process and enhance doctor-patient communication. It allows patients to receive prescriptions online after in-person consultations and ask health-related questions via a chat feature. The platform is built using Node.js for the back-end and React.js with Redux for the front-end, following the MVC design pattern.
